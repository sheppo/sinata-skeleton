### Purpose
The Sinatra Skeleton:

1. Provides a foundation for building challenges.
2. Demonstrates a reasonable set of practices around building Sinatra applications.
3. Eases the transition to Rails.
4. Demonstrates that it is not **required** that all models in `app/models` be
   `ActiveRecord` backed!
5. Gives bare-bones RSpec skeleton wherewith to start building the practice of testing

### Quickstart

1.  `bundle install`
2.  `shotgun config.ru`
